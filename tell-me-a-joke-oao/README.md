This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install packages:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## How was the frontend generated?

Susan had given this prompt to v1.dev:

```
Develop a beautiful and compelling single page react app for generating jokes from a user input form. 

Add a form with free form text and hard-coded drop down options for users to customize the Joke Parameters

Choose which parameters you'd like to offer your users
For example, allow users to select:
A topic from a list of options (work, people, animals, food, television, etc.)
A tone for the joke (witty, sarcastic, silly, dark, goofy, etc.)
The type of joke (pun, knock-knock, story, etc.)
The "temperature" (how much randomness/creativity to add to the joke)
```
